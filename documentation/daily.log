* Log of development
** General outline of project
*** TODO Extract 3D skeleton of subject
**** DONE Get openpose to work
     CLOSED: [2017-08-29 ÁÅ´ 16:52]
     OpenPose still crashes on exit, but it's almost working.
     The next step now will be to read more about the library
     before I move on to the next item.
     The issue is being discussed [[https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/issues/185][here]].

**** TODO Extend openpose functionality to work with kinect
**** TODO Get 3D pose from the kinect depth camera
**** TODO Estimate pose from multiple kinect cameras (ROS-TMS integration)
*** TODO Preform Human Activity Recognition
**** TODO Find implementation of HAR form 3D pose
**** TODO Find dataset for HAR from 3D pose
     Possible [[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-4640-7_10][dataset]].
**** TODO Get HAR algorithms to recognize a fall
*** TODO Calculate risk of falling
**** TODO Create network for short-time evaluation
***** TODO Train network using the output form HAR as ground truth
**** TODO Create network for long-time evaluation

* Other notes
** OpenPose ROS integration
   There are some frameworks for integrating openpose with ROS, but 
   I choose to write my own. The reason for this is because I can 
   directly start writing it to work with Kinect and so on. 
   (i.e. subscribe to the right topics)

** Different activities
   To predict the long term probabilities, we have to also be able to 
   recognize the current activity/state.
   
   | Time  | Activity/state | Network type     | Desired Output        |
   |-------+----------------+------------------+-----------------------|
   | Short | Walking        | Convolutional NN | Recognize activity    |
   |       | Sitting        |                  |                       |
   |       | Standing       |                  |                       |
   |       | FALL           |                  |                       |
   |       | Vitals?        |                  |                       |
