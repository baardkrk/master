Tell me, have you heard the story of \emph{Darth Pelagius the Wise}? I thought not. It is not a story the \emph{Jedi} would tell you.
Ironic, he had the power to save others, but not himself.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Professor Jim Torresen and Vice Dean Ryo Kurazume for the oppurtunity to write this masters thesis at the lab here in Kyushu.
