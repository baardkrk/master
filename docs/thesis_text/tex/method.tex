\chapter{Human 3D pose from depth images}

Skeleton models


\section{2D detection transfer}

(First ideas.)

Torso placement and tree structure for placing.

Fit to human standard model (rules for symmetry and lengths)

Occlusion problem, and interpolated points, visual hull constraints

We train the network on both depth images and a kinematic model of each 3D ground truth location.

\section{Pose from CNN over depth maps}

We create a separate 'side-view' detection map for each 'frontal' detection map. This reduces the convolution operations, since we don't have to convolve over the whole 3D space.
