\section{Human Pose Estimation}

The robot we're developing needs to be able to robustley detect humans, so information about their state can be gathered and analyzed. To accomplish this task, we propose a system that uses RGB-D data in combination with IR images to estimate the 3D pose of humans. In addition we propose a manual algorithm for estimation of occluded parts that can not be directly observed. 

A lot of work has already been done on human pose estimation, however our approach focuse
