\chapter*{Preface}
First, I would like to thank my supervisors Jim TÃ¸rresen and Ryo Kurazume for their support, guidance and patience during the development of this project. Second, my HR manager Marit Flendstad Kruse, for her support in letting me combine work with the writing of this thesis. Further I would like to thank everyone at the Kurazume-lab for their welcome and help during my stay at Kyushu University, and my friends and family for proofreading and encouragement.
