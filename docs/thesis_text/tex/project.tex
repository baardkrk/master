\section{Modifying the dataset}

The dataset had origin for the ground-truth keypoint locations off to the side, so we translated all ground-truth keypoint locations to the camera frame and stored this in files indexed to the accompanying depth image. We ended up with \texttt{TODO NUM} different depth images capturing various poses from \texttt{TODO NUM} different activities, and two different camera views of the same activities. This provides robustness to orientation in relation to the camera for our subject.
