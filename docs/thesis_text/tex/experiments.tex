\begin{itemize}
\item compare the learnable parameters between the openpose architecture and the depthpose architecture.
\item calculate the euler distance between joint-locations output by the pipeline and the ground-truth locations (skeleton matching must be preformed, since it is not guaranteed that the IDs for the skeletons would match)
\item compare accuracy and complexity with different values for $T_{P}$ and $T_{C}$
\item assess the usefullness of the articulation network by comparing the joint locations after refinement with joint locations output at $t = T_{P} + 1$, where just limb-maps from the first stage are used in the prediction.
\item could $T_{P}$ be reduced to achieve usefulness of the articulation network?
\end{itemize}
