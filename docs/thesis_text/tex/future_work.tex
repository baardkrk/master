\chapter{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find a more accurate pose from a temporal algorithm that takes input from a series of depth images from a single viewpoint.
\item Combine multiple viewpoints for a more accurate pose.
\item Human activity recognition using 3D pose provided by the method proposed in this paper.
\item Train the network over a larger dataset in unstructured environments and with multiple people present.
\end{itemize}
