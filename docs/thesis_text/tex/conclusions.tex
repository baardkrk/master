\chapter{Conclusions}

The data extraction method needs to be severely optimized before it can run on a larger dataset. 

Currently no conclusions can be drawn about the proposed architecture due to the lack of experiments. However, It should be possible to use the articulation network to provide complete poses, even if key landmarks are occluded. I addition, the articulation network should provide enough information in the refinement loop to allow for a shorter number of loops to be done.
