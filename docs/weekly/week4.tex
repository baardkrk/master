\section{Fitting to model}
My goal this week was to finish this, but I'm still tearing my hair out over it. Mostly, this is due to some rendering issues in rviz. The program runs fast -- at approx. 7.5 - 8 fps. However, the skeleton seems to lag as it updates, and not everything is drawn at once. I shall look into this further.

A couple of things were implemented this week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Accessor functions for the limbs and their attributes.
\item \texttt{'set-'} functions for changing a \texttt{Person} object's keypoints post initialization.
\item Repositioning of keypoints according to fitting the model\footnote{There are still some challenges with this. The results I get seem to compensate too much, and I'm not sure the positions stay updated.}.
\end{itemize}

I also tried to develop a function so only the ``best'' limbs would contribute to scaling the model, but I ended up using a weighted average of all the limbs, as I then didn't need to sort them. The result from this weighted sum was a lot more stable.

In addition, the keypoint positions start to get unpredictable when the subject is too close, $<$500mm, or too far away $>$3000mm. However, the point cloud seems to be fine at these distances, so I'm wondering what's going on.

Next week I want to continue implementing some ideas for refining the 3D position of the keypoints, but I feel I should also try some different approaches I've read about that might yield better results:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using depth points between the two keypoints to estimate a unit vector. (Then place the keypoint along this to the scaled length.) This might be dropped in favor of bulletpoint 3.
\item Improve tracker so I can use previous frames to estimate new position of limbs not observed in the current frame.
\item Compare the accuracy of this manual keypoint allocation with machine learning techniques.
\end{itemize}
