This work is part of a Masters degree in Informatics: Robotics and Intelligent Systems at the University of Oslo. The work was written as a collaboration between the ROBIN lab at the University of Oslo, and the Kurazume Laboratory at Kyushu University as part of the exchange program COINMAC funded by The Norwegian Research Council.

A special thanks goes to my supervisors, Jim TÃ¸rresen and Ryo Kurazume, for both providing me with the fantastic oppurtunity to study abroad and for all their support and guidance througout this project.

I would like to sincierely thank the staff and students at the laboratory for welcoming me to Japan, helping me with the administrative tasks in everyday life, including me in social activities and of course teaching me a little Japanese.

Many thanks goes to all my friends and family back in Norway for supporting me despite the vast distance and time difference.
At last, I would like to thank my friends Karl Magnus, Soman, Mathias and the rest of the informatics students with whom I started at the university. Thank you for making my time here unforgettable.
