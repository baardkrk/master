ROS specific programs
=====================

For displaying depth images, the GT skeletons and the estimated skeleton
 - Fixed frame for each kinect frame
 - Topic for PCL2 (camera/depth_registered/points)

A ros program running the prediction real-time
 - Must be able to subscribe to a depth-topic
 - Possibility for support from multiple depth topics 
    - Automatic stitching from ICP matching or provided transform between
      cameras


Machine Learning part
=====================

Datapreprocessing
 - Take frame from every 5 second of each clip as input to the trainingset
 - Program for refining GT bvh files to 16 keypoint GT joint locations
 - Refine GT joint locations into GT location evidence maps with gaussian
   distributions around each point. 2 sets: coplanar evidence to the camera
   plane, and perpendicular evidence (depth locations).
